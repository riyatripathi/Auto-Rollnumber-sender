The above code fits better on my system but it can vary system to system.

To set up this code perfectly in your system,Perform the following steps:

- Take the Screenshot of the google meet after opening the comment `section/message` section as shown below

- Now change the corrdinates in the code by your coordinate values and save the changes
- Run the code

## Keep your meet open during the process
