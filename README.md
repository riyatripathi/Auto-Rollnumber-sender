# Auto-Rollnumber-sender

The above code fits better on my system but it can vary system to system.

To set up this code perfectly in your system,Perform the following steps:

- Take the Screenshot of the google meet after opening the comment `section/message` section as shown below

![(https://github.com/riyatripathi/Auto-Rollnumber-sender/raw/main/screenshot.bmp)]
- Take this screenshot to `Paint` and note the coordinates of `writting box` and `sending button`
- Now change the corrdinates in the code by your coordinate values and save the changes
- Run the code

## Keep your meet open during the process
